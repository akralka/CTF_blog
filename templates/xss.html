    <h2>What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?</h2>

    <p class="subtitle">XSS</p> 
    <p class="ex1"> Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, 
        and to access any of the user's data. The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript,
        but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other type of code that the browser may execute. 
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:
        <ul class="b">
           <li> Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.</li>
           <li> The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p class="subtitle">Stored XSS</p> 
    <p class="ex1">This attack occurs when an application or website has malware that has attacked all of its HTTP response codes. 
        It is also sometimes referred to as <strong>Persistent XSS</strong>. This code can be placed in places such as login forms or comment sections. The danger of 
        this attack is that it does not require any response from the user. All the attacker has to do is drop the bait and wait for the results. </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Reflected XSS</p> 
    <p class="ex1">Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, 
        or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.
        If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker, then the attacker's script executes in the user's browser, in the context of that user's session with the application.</p>
        <p class="centered-text">
            e.g. https://my.domain?id=&lt;script&gt;/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/&lt;/script&gt;
    </p></p>
        <p class="subtitle">DOM-based XSS</p> 
    <p class="ex1">DOM Based XSS attack is executed as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” 
        in the victim’s browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code
         runs in an “unexpected” manner. That is, the page itself (the HTTP response that is) does 
         not change, but the client side code contained in the page executes
         differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment.</p>
