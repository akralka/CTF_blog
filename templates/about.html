    <p class="ex1">
        As part of the <strong>Web and mobile application security</strong> course, I created a web application in the form of a blog with many different vulnerabilities. 
        Your task is to understand how attacks on web applications work and how you can use the vulnerabilities you find to
        <ul class="b">
            <li>extract unsecured user data</li>
            <li>gain access to other users' accounts</li>
            <li>prepare a payload harmful to other users that can be placed on this site </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1">
        and so on. The topic of the blog is vulnerabilities that can be exploited in web applications. 
        It is worthwhile to familiarize yourself with them, as some of them can be found in this application.
        <p class="centered-text">
        Your task is divided into two parts.

    <p class="subtitle">Part I</p>
    <p class="ex1">As described above, the application is vulnerable to many different types of attacks. 
        I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the vulnerabilities described on this blog, but also look into other available sources. 
        (My recommendation would be <strong><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">Web Security Academy</a></strong>). 
        Then try to find these vulnerabilities and expose them.</p>

    <img class="main_image" src="{{ url_for('uploaded_file', filename='vuln.png') }}" alt="Reload to obtain a photo!">
    <p class="subtitle">Part II</p>
    <p class="ex1">An additional feature on the blog are hidden flags based on the CTF (Capture-The-Flag) principle. 
        In some places, finding a vulnerability will result in finding a flag (according to the pattern: <strong>flag={string}</strong>).
        There are <strong>10</strong> flags. 
        <p class="centered-text">
            Good luck!
    </p></p>
    <p class="ex1">
        <strong>P.S.</strong> Remember that it is not about finding flags, but about understanding selected vulnerabilities, 
        flags are just an addition suggesting that you have found a vulnerability! The most important thing is how you did it and why it was possible!
