                <p> "Password hashing is defined as putting a password through a hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2, etc) (note that algorithms such as md5 are considered deprecated) 
                    to turn plaintext into an unintelligible series of numbers and letters. 
                    This is important for basic security hygiene because,
                    in the event of a security breach, any compromised passwords are unintelligible to the bad actor. As a result, the theft of this information is considerably more difficult."
                </p>
                <p>"Salting is the act of adding a series of random characters to a password before going through the hashing function."

                <p>"JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object."</p>
                <p>"In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
                    <ul class="b">
                        <li>Header - The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.</li>
                        <li>Payload - The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. </li>
                        <li>Signature - The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is."</li>

                <div class="comment-header">Insecure direct object references (IDOR)</div>
                <p">"IDOR are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.
                    Most commonly they are associated with horizontal privilege escalation, but they can also arise in relation to vertical privilege escalation.
                    IDORs may take different shapes. Some examples include:
                    <ul class="b">
                        <li>IDORs that directly reference database objects</li>
                        <p class="centered-text">
                            e.g. https://my.domain/customer_account?id=123 <br><br>
                            Here, the customer number is used directly as a record index in queries that are performed on the back-end database.
                            If no other controls are in place, an attacker can simply modify the customer_number value, bypassing access controls to view the records of other customers. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <li>IDORs that directly reference static files</li>
                        <p class="centered-text">
                            e.g. https://my.domain/static/secret.txt<br><br>
                            IDOR vulnerabilities often arise when sensitive resources are located in static files on the server-side filesystem."

                    <p>"File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name,
                         type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary
                         and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.<br><br>
                        
                         From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files,
                          and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server."</p>
